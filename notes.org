I'm not sure how diligent I'll be in updating the status of fixed
bugs etc., so the dates associated with each entry might be an
indication of how likely a given entry is to be out of date. ;-)

10.11.2018:
- Autonice doesn't support the infai_all queue. Jobs submitted to
  the infai_all queue are not taken into account when computing the
  number of users on infai_1 and infai_2. The workaround is to not use
  infai_all.

06.09.2017:
- Setting the nice value causes a release of held jobs, so autonice
  will automatically release all held jobs. (Reported by Silvan.)

06.09.2017:
- When using autonice, it is currently not possible to affect the
  order of one's own job, e.g. to defer a job with naturally higher
  priority in order to let another job of one's own past. One simple
  but crude way to change this is to have autonice only affect jobs
  whose nice value is identical to one of the two nice values that
  autonice.

06.09.2017:
- It would be useful to gather statistics about grid usage, e.g. a
  plot over time of who is using how many cores and who is waiting at
  a given time, perhaps also adding data points that indicate at which
  time each user performs an autonice iteration. Then we can hopefully
  see how quickly and how successfully autonice manages to balance the
  usage. By observing this for some time, we can perhaps also
  determine reasonable values for the frequency at which autonice runs.
